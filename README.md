# hngx-stage1
This is the stage one task for the HNGX program. Wish me well, thanks.

So, I feel you should know what the task is all about. Enjoy this very short one....
# Objective:
  Create and host an endpoint using any programming language of your choice.
  The endpoint should take two GET request query parameters and return specific information in JSON format.
  The information required includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Slack name</li>
        <li>Current day of the week</li>
        <li>Current UTC time (with validation of +/- 2)</li>
        <li>Track</li>
        <li>The GitHub URL of the file being run</li>
        <li>The Github URL of the full source code</li>
        <li>A Status Code of Success</li>
      </ul>

    And more...
